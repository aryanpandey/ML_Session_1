    "Let's start this off with something called a support vector classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of a Support Vector Classifier is to make a decision boundary in between the \"support vectors\" which is basically the \"end points\" of each of the\n",
    "classification regions\n",

    "\n",
    "Once these support vectors have been found out we take the mean position between this and draw a line to demarcate the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/svclassify.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with doing this is that it varies a lot depending on the data which implies it doesn't do so well with outliers in the dataset, such as this\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/svoutlier.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with this SV classfiers have \"Soft Margins\" which let outliers exist without making a ridiculously stupid decision boundary.This Soft Margin is decided \n",
    "by using <br>Cross Validation to determine number of outliers to be allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/svoutlierbound.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sooo.. SV classifiers look cool right since they can handle outliers as well ,well yes but also no. SV classifiers fail to work when there's a lot more overlap <br>than in the above\n",
    "diagrams ,like this\n",
